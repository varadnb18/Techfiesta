## 🌟 Overview

InC acts as your personal digital yoga instructor. By turning on your webcam, the app instantly tracks your body movements and provides live, mathematical feedback on your posture. Whether you are practicing the Cobra Pose or balancing in the Tree Pose, InC calculates an accuracy score and challenges you to hold the perfect form.

It also features **Poco**, an AI-powered conversational chatbot built with the Google Gemini API, to help guide you through yoga philosophy and technical questions.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Architecture

Our AI pipeline uses a hybrid **"Eyes + Brain"** approach to achieve high-performance, real-time tracking in the browser:

1. **The Eyes (Google MediaPipe):** 
   Extracts 33 high-precision 3D landmarks (x, y, z coordinates) from your webcam feed at 60 FPS.
2. **The Brain (Custom TensorFlow Neural Network):**
   We discarded out-of-the-box models (like MoveNet) and trained our own **Keras Neural Network** on a custom dataset of ~1,600 images across 6 distinct poses. The model processes the 2D coordinates (x, y) to predict your current posture with ultra-low latency.
3. **The Geometric Gate:**
   To guarantee perfection, the raw AI prediction is passed through mathematical geometric gates (e.g., measuring the exact angle between your shoulder, hip, and knee) to ensure your form is physically correct before scoring.

## 🚀 Features

- **Live Pose Detection**: 100% client-side inference using WebGL/WASM. No webcam footage is ever sent to a server.
- **6 Supported Postures**: 
  - 🪑 Chair Pose
  - 🐍 Cobra Pose
  - 🐕 Downward Dog
  - 🧍‍♂️ Shoulder Stand
  - 🌳 Tree Pose
  - 🪵 Plank Pose
- **Fault-Tolerant Hybrid Scoring**: The final accuracy score uses a `Math.max()` blend between the Neural Network's confidence and the Geometric Gate's pure math, ensuring a smooth, highly resilient user experience that isn't easily fooled by bad lighting or weird camera angles.
- **Targeted Limb Highlighting & Text Coaching**: The Geometric Math Gate precisely calculates your joint angles to identify the exact point of failure. It draws *only* the incorrect limbs in **red** while keeping correct limbs **green**, and pushes real-time, actionable text coaching to the screen (e.g., *"Straighten your back!"* or *"Bend your knees more!"*).
- **Timer & High Scores**: The hold-timer only increments if your accuracy is above the threshold!
- **Poco AI Assistant**: A built-in Flask backend integrating the Google Gemini API for fitness and yoga chatting.
- **Cloud Database**: Integrated with Firebase to save user sessions and high scores.
